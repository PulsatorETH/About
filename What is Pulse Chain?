Pulse Chain is an upcoming Layer 2 Block Chain running on the Ethereum Network. This Blockchain will run on a POS (Proof of Stake) Consensus. Proof of Stake Consensus models require holders of their native token, in this case it is the $PLS token. A minimum of 500,000 PLS tokens are required to become a Node Validator on Pulse Chain.
