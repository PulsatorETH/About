Pulsator is a cryptocurrency on the Ethereum Network and soon to launch on Pulse Chain. The $PNODE token acts as a participation utility in a larger Node Validation service for the upcoming Layer 2 Network “Pulse Chain”.

$PNODE holders will benefit both from rising price due to $PNODE demand, as well as share of the long term profits made thru the Validator Treasury. The token and its community will act as one large Pulse Chain Validator…. Or “Pulsator” for short!
