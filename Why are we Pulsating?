We refer to our $PNODE validating utility as “Pulsating”. 

Pulse Chain validation will have a high cost to entry as a means to attract more serious validators. The 500,000 staked PLS tokens required to become a Pulse Chain validator will be NON REFUNDABLE. In order to begin validating new blocks and receiving a share of the transaction fee a validator must be among the top 33 staked validators referred to as “Linked Validators”. The size of your stake boosts the position in rotation as a validator. 75% of Pulse Chain transaction fees are to be split among the Blockchain Validators!


As an individual it can be hard to not only accumulate, but commit large amounts of $PLS to consistently be a “Linked Validator” on Pulse Chain. As a community we can consistently be among the top 33 validators in the validator pool and increase the regularity of the passive income. A large portion of our $PNODE tax will be used to fund our $PLS treasury to begin staking and validating on Pulse Chain.

 Additionally as a $PNODE holder, after we have established our Validation Service, we will offer staking for our “Pulsators”. Staking will allow for larger compounding returns from the validation service based on the amount of $PNODE staked. Our staking utility will not be made available until we have established our “Pulsation Service” so we can build a strong Treasury Reserve for immediate passive income for our $PNODE stakers. We also will not release $PNODE staking too soon so that our $PLS holdings can build to a healthy enough level that we can consistently maintain a “Linked Validator” status on Pulse Chain. The strength of this project will be its ability to create an uninterrupted cash flow for all of our holders and that requires a large build and reserve.
