We refer to our $PNODE validating utility as “Pulsating”. 

Pulse Chain validation will have a high cost to entry as a means to attract more serious validators. The 500,000 staked PLS tokens required to become a Pulse Chain validator will be NON REFUNDABLE. In order to begin validating new blocks and receiving a share of the transaction fee a validator must be among the top 33 staked validators referred to as “Linked Validators”. The size of your stake boosts the position in rotation as a validator. 75% of Pulse Chain transaction fees are to be split among the Blockchain Validators!


As an individual it can be hard to not only accumulate, but commit large amounts of $PLS to consistently be a “Linked Validator” on Pulse Chain. As a community we can consistently be among the top 33 validators in the validator pool and increase the regularity of the passive income. A large portion of our $PNODE tax will be used to fund our $PLS treasury to begin staking and validating on Pulse Chain.
